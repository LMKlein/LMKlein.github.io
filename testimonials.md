# Testimonials
As part of the YA writing community, I've collaborated with new and established authors. In my educational work, I've had the opportunity to tackle a variety of writing and editing projects with various educational and non-profit organizations. Some of my collaborators were kind enough to share their experiences here.



> _L.M. Klein is a talented and insightful editor whose invaluable feedback has helped me improve my work. Her careful attention to detail and in-depth notes make for a thorough critique, while her respect for my vision means I can trust her input. I’m so impressed with her ability to get at the heart of character motivations and to hone in on important plot points. Working with her has given me a clear view of next steps to take to complete my revision._ 

~Parker Peevyhouse, author of WHERE FUTURES END (Penguin/Dawson, 2016), THE ECHO ROOM (Tor Teen, 2018), and STRANGE EXIT (coming January 2020)

> _Laurel is a wonderful editor! Her prompt and regular communication let me know I was a priority throughout the time we worked together. Critique is never easy, but she showed me things in my book I didn't even know were there and helped me bring them out. She's the perfect editor to minimize weaknesses, showcase strengths, and renew your enthusiasm for your project. I absolutely recommend working with her. Get ready to fall in love with your novel all over again._ 

~Kat Helgeson, author of SAY NO TO THE BRO (Simon and Schuster, 2017) and THE CATCH (Four of Us, 2018)


<br/>

> _Laurel is one of the most talented editors with whom I have ever worked. She is incredibly adept at helping a writer dig more deeply into character, and is capable of drawing out a writer's best and richest work. She is not an editor who cleans up punctuation and messy wording (though she can). She is one who teases out the true heart of your story--character motivations, plot intricacies, honesty of voice, and beautiful prose. Laurel will empower you to make your writing stronger. She'll push you to craft a more compelling story. Her high standards and strong instincts were a game-changer for me in my own manuscript. I simply cannot recommend her enough! You won't find a better partner for your work in the freelance world._ 

~Lindsay Lackey, author of ALL THE IMPOSSIBLE THINGS (Roaring Brook Press/Macmillan, 2019)

> _If you have an opportunity to employ Laurel do so immediately, so you don’t miss out on having a great talent on your team._
> 
> _I hired Laurel as an education consultant to help with an interactive learning experience project that I inherited that was severely off scope, budget and timeline. Laurel was a tremendous asset in getting that project back on track and completed. She understood the challenges of the national office, worked well with the subject matter experts to clearly communicate the content, and listened carefully to the needs and varying desires of our community users. Her balanced and creative approach allowed her to develop innovative solutions that ensured we launched a software program that our education network was proud to use._
> 
> _Laurel is the complete package -- smart, imaginative, and resourceful. She is an excellent listener and communicator. She asks thoughtful questions to ensure she truly understands your project goals, the storyline and the experience you are trying to create. She also stays in contact so you know exactly where her piece of the project stands, and she is receptive and appreciative to feedback._
> 
> _In addition, it is a true pleasure to work with Laurel. She has a great personality and is fun to work with. I wouldn’t hesitate to hire her again._
