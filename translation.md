# Translation Services (starting at 0,80 Danish crowns/word, plus 25% VAT)
## Offering Danish-to-English and Spanish-to-English translation for select clients

I'm an overachiever in general, but especially when it comes to language and storytelling. As a translator, I offer the often hard-to-find combination of Danish and Spanish proficiency, excellent editorial chops, and an author's attention to the nuances of language. I'm also fast, dependable, and never settle for less than first-rate work.

I have translated everything from cookbooks to product descriptions, from personal websites to B2C and B2B newsletters. My speciality is in translating and localizing texts with an eye to the client's voice and branding, building translations that flow like originals and authentically engage readers.

Included in my translation services:
- A phone call or email exchange to talk about your intended audience 
- A full translation pass 
- Line-editing: I will go through the entire translation to smooth out syntax and make sure each sentence is not just technically correct, but has the unique voice and branding of the original text
- Line notes: As necessary, I will insert comments explaining my choices, making recommendations, or asking for your input
- One revision pass: you will have the opportunity to review the translation and request one round of revisions anywhere needed within 2 weeks of receipt
- After the revision pass, I will proofread the completed translation to check for typos, clean it of editorial markings, and then return it to you
