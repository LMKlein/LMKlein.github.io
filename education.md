# Curriculum Services 
## Classroom Study Guides & Thematic Units

I am interested in partnering with YA and MG authors to develop classroom guides for your contracted or published novels. Having worked in both classrooms and curriculum development for nearly twenty years, I am comfortable developing engaging questions and activity suggestions aligned to the Common Core to help students and educators dive deep into your text.
