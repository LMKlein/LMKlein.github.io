## Full Manuscript Critiques: Young Adult & Middle Grade 

You did it! You have a book—or something very near to being one. 

First of all--congratulations! You did something most people never accomplish, so fire off those confetti canons.

If you’re here, it means that you’re ready to take the next step and dig deep into revisions. Maybe you’re starting to think about querying and want to strengthen the bones of your manuscript before you take the leap. Maybe you’ve already queried and racked up requests for fulls only to receive vague rejections. Or perhaps you want to give a specific manuscript a new chance, but the feedback you’ve gotten from critique partners, betas, or even editors is pointing at a very different book than the one you want to write. Maybe you’re pursuing self-publishing and need an editor’s eye before you take the next step. 

That’s where I come in.  



### What you get when you put your manuscript in my hands:

- Respect for your work from start to finish. As a writer myself, I critique the way I want to be critiqued: thorough, honest, enthusiastic, and tough.
- Years of experience writing, revising, and editing under deadline, packaged with a positive, encouraging attitude
- A full critique looking at macro and micro aspects of your novel
- Line notes on the manuscript itself
- After I read but before I send you feedback: An email exchange where you have the opportunity to outline critique partner or agent feedback, and to share specific questions or concerns you have (perfect when you’ve previously amassed vague or conflicting feedback)
- A detailed editorial letter pointing out strengths and areas to further develop, suggestions for next steps, and thoughts on past feedback you chose to share with me
- A discount on a second reading of the revised manuscript 
- **Base price for a developmental edit with both line notes and edit letter** for Summer 2020, starting at $600USD, up to 80K words. (For longer works, contact me at LMKleinedits@gmail.com) EU-based clients and individuals without tax-exempt status will be subject to 25% VAT.  

This level of support allows me to provide the most effective level of feedback to authors. If, however, that's out of your budget, do feel free to reach out regardless, as **we can discuss customized levels of support for a variety of budgets.** I want you to grow as a writer, but we can determine together what that looks like at this time.

**If you connected with me at a conference, or you were referred to me by one of my previous clients,** contact me. Special discounts may apply. 

Please note: Manuscript critiques are for **full middle grade or young adult manuscripts.** No picture books, poetry, short stories, or partial manuscripts. However, if you're drafting and stuck, send me an email and we can talk about other options.   



### Trying to choose between editors? Here’s a bit more about me. 
- Contemporary, magical realism, fairy tale retellings, and urban fantasy are particularly my jam.  
- I am especially strong with voice, character development, and plot logic. 
- I bring years of writing and editing experience to your manuscript, as well as a careful eye toward the story you want to tell. I will ask about your vision and your characters, so that my feedback can fast-track you toward excavating the heart of your story.
- I believe the world needs diverse books, and that #ownvoices authors should be prioritized in the telling of those stories. 
- Although I don’t offer manuscript proofreading, I have a strong eye for grammar and syntax and will note significant issues in passing.
- I'm currently offering a much fuller critique package than most (edit letter, in-line notes, and a back-and-forth where we sift through previous feedback together and strategize solutions). I am a problem-solver by nature, and I thrive on helping others take their creative work to the next level. As a result, my process is collborative, and it centers your vision for the MS while offering perspective on external factors that should be taken into consideration. TL;DR: I **want** you to succeed, and my feedback is always aimed at improving your mastery of craft beyond any single project. I can't guarantee you'll land this project with an agent or a publisher; I can guarantee you will acquire insights and tools to take this--and future works--to a new level.  


## Other Editing Services (not for manuscript-length works)

### Query Submission Review ($25 for first ten pages; note that EU clients and US clients without tax-exempt status will be subject to 25% VAT) 

Whether you're preparing to query or looking to revamp a query, your sample pages need to be tight, engaging, and unforgettable. I'd love to help you. This package includes a detailed edit of your first ten pages, plus an opportunity for you to ask questions or clarifications. 

Note: Pages must be submitted in standard manuscript format: 1" margins, 12 pt Times New Roman font, double-spaced 


### Lifeline Developmental Edits (rates dependant on needs; contact me for details)
This is for the messy unfinished drafts, the exasperating and infuriating ones that you are still madly in love with and cannot abandon. 

Let's talk. I'll help you develop a detailed plan forward.



### Proofreading (rates dependant on needs; contact me for details)

Grammar cleanups ONLY for webpages, non-manuscript-length translation work, advertising copy, white papers, etc. This option is best suited to works on solid footing in regard to their content and presentation; no developmental or structural content review is included, and fact-checking is not provided. 

I provide all changes in Word with track changes enabled (and an explanation when necessary) so that you can review individual items before committing to your final draft. 



### Line Edits (rates dependant on needs; contact me for details)

I offer an eye toward the presentation and organization of content for webpages, articles, and other documents, as well as necessary grammar and syntax fixes. I leverage my background in curriculum and instruction to help you identify ways to effectively move your readers through information and draw their eyes where they need to be. 

This option is ideal for small business owners and entrepreneurs looking to punch up copy or to ensure they’ve appropriately broken down complex information for their audience. It’s also ideal for international clients looking to hone their English-language websites with the nuance offered by an editor and author with native English fluency. 

I provide comments and changes in Word with track changes enabled (and an explanation when necessary) so that you can review individual items before making revisions and committing to your final draft. If you make significant content changes, this option includes a re-read at a 50% discount to review your revisions and offer additional suggestions.
