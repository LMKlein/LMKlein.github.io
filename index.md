# _Hone your craft, polish your message, engage your audience._ 

## About Me
I am a former literature teacher with a master's degree in curriculum and instruction, in addition to being an active member of SCBWI and a member of the kidlit community. I love stories. I thrive on helping others find clarity during the vital and sometimes messy process of turning an idea into a story, but I also enjoy the challenge of enhancing technical documents for clarity and readability. 

If you don't see a service that meets your project needs, contact me directly; I enjoy new challenges.
