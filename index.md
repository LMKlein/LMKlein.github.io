# _Hone your craft, polish your message, engage your audience._ 

## About Me
I am a former literature teacher with a master's degree in curriculum and instruction, in addition to being an active member of SCBWI and a member of the kidlit community. I love stories. I thrive on helping others find clarity during the vital and sometimes messy process of turning an idea into a story, but I also enjoy the challenge of enhancing technical documents for clarity and readability. 

If you don't see a service that meets your project needs, contact me directly; I enjoy new challenges. 









### Classroom Study Guides 

I am interested in partnering with YA and MG authors to develop classroom guides for your contracted or published novels. Having worked in both classrooms and curriculum development for nearly twenty years, I am comfortable developing engaging questions and activity suggestions aligned to the Common Core to help students and educators dive deep into your text.

Contact me for rates.
